    <p>The NFL team known as the Rams began their history in the now now non-existent AFL playing in Cleveland, Ohio. The Rams left the AFL and Cleveland one and nine years later, respectively.</p>
    <p>The Rams spent 1946-1994 in Southern California in the city of Los Angeles. The first NFL team to play in LA would also see the first black football player in 1946.</p>
    <p>The Rams moved to St. Louis in 1995. Here are some of the memorable moments from that time:</p> 
    <ol>
    	<li>After the 1999 season, the Rams won <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXXIV">Super Bowl XXXIV</a> in 2000 by beating the Tennessee Titans, 23-16.</li>
    	<li>After the 2001 season, (which the Rams finished with an NFL best 14-2 record), the Rams played the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XXXVI. The Rams lost 17-14.</li>
    	<li>The Rams had 11 losing seasons from 2005 to 2015.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>On January 12, 2016, it was officially announced that the Rams would be moving back to LA. They are planning on playing in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum (home of college football's USC Trojans) until they begin playing in a new standium that will be built by 2019 in the LA suburb of Inglewood.</p>
